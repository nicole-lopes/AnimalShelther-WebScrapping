# AnimalShelther-WebScrapping
This Python project leverages tools like BeautifulSoup to scrape data from various animal shelter websites. Users first input their desired city and type of animal. The program then retrieves relevant information, including the animalâ€™s name, ID number, gender, age, breed, and colour, helping streamline the search for potential adopters.
